# WEB103 Project 3 - World Cup 2026 Fan Space

Submitted by: Oscar Mochizaki

About this web app: **World Cup 2026 Fan Space is a virtual community space where users can explore FIFA World Cup 2026 matches by host city. Users can select a visual location card, navigate to a unique city detail page, and view all matches/events connected to that location from a PostgreSQL database.**

Time spent: 4 hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
* [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**

  *  [x] **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  *  [x] **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT * FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**
* [x] **The web app displays a title.**
* [x] **Website includes a visual interface that allows users to select a location they would like to view.**

  * [x] *Note: A non-visual list of links to different locations is insufficient.*
* [x] **Each location has a detail page with its own unique URL.**
* [x] **Clicking on a location navigates to its corresponding detail page and displays list of all events from the `events` table associated with that location.**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] An additional page shows all possible events

  * [ ] Users can sort *or* filter events by location.
* [ ] Events display a countdown showing the time remaining before that event

  * [ ] Events appear with different formatting when the event has passed (ex. negative time, indication the event has passed, crossed out, etc.).

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Added a World Cup themed visual design with host city cards.
* [x] Added hover effects for location cards.
* [x] Added individual event cards showing match group, date, time, and stadium.
* [x] Added backend API routes for all events and events filtered by location.
* [x] Used React Router so each city has its own unique URL.

## Notes

One challenge I encountered was connecting the React frontend, Express backend, and Render PostgreSQL database together. I also had to make sure each host city had its own unique route and that clicking a visual card displayed only the events associated with that location.

Another challenge was configuring the PostgreSQL database on Render and using the `psql` command to create and verify the `events` table.
